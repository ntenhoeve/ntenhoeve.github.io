        About the introspect Framework
       </h1>
       Almost everyday new libraries, frameworks and tools are being released by the developer community, many of which reinvent the wheel.
       <br>
       <br>
       This is called the ‘Yet Another Framework Syndrome’ (YAFS), or in more general terms ‘Not Invented Here’ (NIH). Whil
       e
        innovation is something we should all welcome, YAFS can lead to confusion and frustration for users because there’s a big risk of it introducing more noise than value.
       <br>
       <br>
       So why develop a new framework while there are so many Java application frameworks out there? 
       <br>
       <br>
       An
       swers:
       <br>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Because its fun (see 
         <a href="http://www.sdn.nl/SDN/Artikelen/tabid/58/view/View/ArticleID/524/Just-because-its-fun.aspx">
          Dutch article
         </a>
         )
        </li>
        <li>
         The journey of developing yet another framework has thought me more than I could have learned implementing an existing framework. Specifically on how other frameworks solved issues that I run into.
        </li>
        <li>
         I love the thoughts behind the 
         <a href="http://nakedobjects.codeplex.com/">
          Naked Objects Framework
         </a>
          (for 
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework">
          .
         </a>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework">
          net
         </a>
         ) and the 
         <a href="http://isis.apache.org/">
          Apache Isis Framework
         </a>
          (for 
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">
          Java
         </a>
         ). But looking at the Apache Isis Framework, there are several things I personally dislike which I tried to do better in the Introspect framework. Note that what I dislike does not mean I thinks is wrong in all cases!
        </li>
        <li>
         The domain objects and service objects 
         (often 
         repository objects
         )
          usually extend a 
         convenience
          class that contains methods to interact with the framework
         / object container
         . Extending such a class is not mandatory, because you can implement these methods in your objects, but to me this ignores the principle of "Naked objects" or 
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_Java_Object">
          POJO’s
         </a>
          .
        </li>
        <li>
         Apache Isis’s uses (depends on) Maven. Maven has its pros (managing 
         dependencies
         , and standardizing the build process), but is also famous for its cons (difficult to configure, steep learning curve, etc, etc).
        </li>
        <li>
         I personally dislike the way Apache Isis 
         manages the editing of
          objects. 
         This is very tightly linked to its persistence framework. I however believe that objects do not necessarily need to be persisted 
         after its been
          edited.
          I prefer to inverse the solution: domain objects can be passed to a method as a method parameter. This method parameter can be edited by a user before a method is executed (depending on how the method is 
         <a>
          annotated
         </a>
         ) the domain object/ method parameter may then be handled by a 
         <a>
          back end service
         </a>
          like a persistence service (or not at all).
